# Conversion-Rate-Modeling-and-Audience-Targeting
Developed a conversion-propensity scoring model for an E-commerce site's data, including data cleaning, data visualization, data classification (one-hot encoding for categorical variables), and segment discovery.

Built and compared multiple machine learning models (logistic model, Random Forest, XGBoost). Achieving 84% testing accuracy and an AUC of 0.96, demonstrating strong discriminative power in predicting customer churn.

Defined a high-CR segment (returning, US, younger than 45, more than 7 pages, Ads) for campaign targeting. Identified a high-impact opportunity to improve conversion rates by analyzing underperforming segment (such as China) with large user volumes.
